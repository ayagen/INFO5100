Q: Write two differences between ArrayList and LinkedList.

1) ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store the elements. LinkedList internally uses a doubly linked list to store the elements. 
2) Manipulation with ArrayList is slow because it internally uses an array. If any element is removed from the array, all the bits are shifted in memory.
