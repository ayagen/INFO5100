Q9. Explain Encapsulation with an example. (Write at least 30-40 words).

Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions that manipulates them. 
Take conference room as example, there may be many conference rooms in a college, and each rooms has the same or different properties like capacity, location, the number of projectors, etc. 
Plus, there are some actions we can take on the conference rooms, such as order a room, cancel a room, make a room as reserved. 
So we can just encapsulate the conference room as a object, then we can just operate on the object to set/get the data of the room, and to call kinds of actions availabe for the object


Q10. What is the difference between Encapsulation and Abstraction
Abstraction is about hiding unwanted details while giving out most essential details, while Encapsulation means hiding the code and data into a single unit such as class or method to protect inner working of an object from outside world.
